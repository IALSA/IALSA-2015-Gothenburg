## Foundation

**Retirement** is a complex construct. We can begin conceptualizing it by recognizing the following observations:   
 - people who retire are of a specific **social class** since they are those, generally, who have jobs from which they are not being fired and that are stable. However, they have made a choice to leave because of a lack of financial need to work. This the stereotypical, but in fact, a small, group.  
 - those who retire are usually engaged in some kinds of activities, though not always, and those activities may include things like bridge jobs or new jobs that are just as **active**. As a result, a substantial proportion of people who tell you that they retire are working again within 5 years   
 - retirement is often conceptualized as not working when older, where in fact many people who were outside of the labor force just **age out** into “retirement”   
 - some people who are fired from a job or let go at say 50 years old, then spend a lot of time **unemployed**, cannot find new employment and then just start calling themselves “retired”    
 
These and other nuances of the retirement construct require the analytic strategy to account for the **progression of individuals through a series of states that describe their relationship with the workforce**, or **retirement trajectory**, as I suggest we call it for short. Once developed, the metrics of retirement trajectory will constitude the pivot of multi-study replication. 

### Retirement metrics


The analytic strategy will shape the list of variables we need to extact from individual studies. 

### Milestone 0: Retirement Transitions
This stage involves preparation of the data available in the study about retirement. The goal is twofold: we need a 1) metric of retirement both flexible enough to address the research question, yet sufficiently simple to 2) permit replication across all participating studies. Naturally, we have no control of what retirement data is provided by studies, so it is reasonable to adapt a certain granularity of retirement data as the inclusion criterion for the Collective. The following are the few possible conceptualizations of retirement.

####6 categories

The research question distinguishes 3 major relationship with the workforce an idividual may have:   
 - employed  (EM)  
 - unemployed (UN)   
 - outside of workforce (OW)    
 
As people in these exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories progress through life, they may start identifying themselves or be classified as "retired", a somewhat loose lable, implying some combination of age, health, and financial circumstances. In order to address the research question it is not sufficient to know whether the person has retired or not: the dynamics of the relationship with the workforce prior to "retirement" forms the basis of comparing cognitive, physical, and well-being trajectories. In light of this we may think of these retireers as qualitatively different, depending on what relationship with the workforce they had in the past.
