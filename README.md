Gothenburg 2015: Mission
---
The project pursues to estimate the impact of the transition into **RETIREMENT** on subsequent **cognitive** decline, **physical** functioning, and **well-being** as compared to remaining in **work**, remaining **unemployed**, or remaining **outside** the labor force.

## Background
 
 A recent analysis of the retirement effect used cross-national comparisons to suggest that when people retire, they “mentally retire” as well: they have higher cognition when they are using it, and when they retire they lose this protection and begin to decline ([Rohwedder & Willis, 2010][1]). Regarding this “use it or lose it” hypothesis ([Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, & Dixon, 1999][2]), retirement is seen as leading to lowered cognition because people stop engaging in cognitively demanding activities when they leave work. However, work is not the only cognitively and physically engaging activity and others such as, further education, self-employment, or artistic endeavors, which are often implicated in cognitive reserve ([Scarmeas & Stern, 2003][3]), can be engaged in following retirement if individuals have the resources necessary to do so. Yet, because many people lack resources upon retirement ([Lusardi & Mitchell, 2007][4]), in part due to poorer financial planning, lowered wages, or the inability to choose when to retire (through redundancy, for instance) they face the same risks of those who are unemployed: lack of cognitive and physical engagement and social isolation. Cognitive theory therefore alternatively suggests that those who retire under these circumstances may experience cognitive decline due to depression or lack of “use”. Yet, increases or maintenance of cognition may occur through cognitively engaging activities, or due to cognitive selection or cognitive reserve. Similarly, those who work in cognitively demanding jobs may see increased declines over those whose work does not require them to practice their cognition while others maintain that lower fluid cognition regardless of retirement (e.g., [Finkel, Andel, Gatz, & Pedersen, 2009][5]). The retirement effect could furthermore be modified by unequal social factors following retirement – such as social engagement, age, or wealth. We will therefore use longitudinal life course datasets that provide detailed information about respondent’s childhood cognition, educational attainment, employment outcomes, and their cognitive performance repeated in later life, along with post-retirement physical, social and intellectual activities, so as to provide an estimate of the overall effect of retirement, and the types of factors that determine vulnerability to cognitive decline amongst retirees.
