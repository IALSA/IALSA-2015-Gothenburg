Analytic Strategy
--- 

The following text outlines the sequence of analytic procedures to which HRS data is proposed to be submitted en route our preparation to the Gothenburg Workshop in October 28-30, 2015.  

The workshop **AIMS** to design the methodology with which to
> estimate the impact of the transition into retirement on subsequent cognitive decline, physical functioning, and well-being as compared to remaining in work, remaining unemployed, or remaining outside the labour force.  

The **OBJECTIVE** of the workshop is to 
> develop a strategy for implementing a multi-study replication of the statistical analyses that evaluates this impact.   


## Foundation

**Retirement** is a complex construct. We can begin conceptualizing it by recognizing the following observations:   
 - people who retire are of a specific **social class** since they are those, generally, who have jobs from which they are not being fired and that are stable but they have made a choice to leave because of a lack of financial need to work. This the stereotypical, but in fact, a small, group.  
 - those who retire are usually engaged in some kinds of activities, though not always, and those activities may include things like bridge jobs or new jobs that are just as **active**. As a result, a substantial proportion of people who tell you that they retire are working again within 5 years   
 - retirement is often conceptualized as not working when older, where in fact many people who were outside of the labor force just **age out** into “retirement”   
 - some people who are fired from a job or let go at say 50 years old, then spend a lot of time **unemployed**, cannot find new employment and then just start calling themselves “retired”    
 
These and other nuances of the retirement construct require the analytic strategy to account for the **progression of individuals through a series of states that describe their relationship with the workforce**, or **retirement trajectory**, as I suggest we call them for short. Once developed, the metrics of retirement trajectory will constitude the pivot of multi-study replication. 

### Retirement metrics


####OW - Outside Workforce

####UN - Unemployed

####EM - Employed

####RA - Retired Active

####RP - Retired Passive



The analytic strategy will shape the list of variables we need to extact from individual studies. 

### Milestone 0: Retirement Transitions

#### Conceptualize and Categorize Retirement

#### Operationalize with available data
